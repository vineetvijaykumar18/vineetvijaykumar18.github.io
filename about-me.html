             </div>
              <p class="about-text">My name is Vineet Vijaykumar, and I have worked in the Visual Effects Industry since 2016 in various Technical Director Roles. Currently I am a Technical Director at CoSA VFX where I write various tools for artists, as well as other general support and feature tasks for the 3D department. Prior to working at CoSA I was a Creature Pipeline TD at Method Studios, where I wrote new features for our set of rigging tools, as well as fixed bugs that came up. My first role at Method was as an Assistant Technical Director, where I was assigned to various feature and commercial projects and supported them by writing show specific tools, fixing bugs, debugging problematic Maya scenes that caused renders to fail, as well as various pipeline support tasks. Some projects I was part of as an Assistant TD included a set of commercials for Target as well as serving as one of the Assistant TDs on Spiderman Homecoming. 
              <br/>
              <br />
              I have a Bachelor of Science Degree from Cogswell College in Digital Arts Engineering where I specialized in rigging and scripting and took a wide variety of 3D and software courses. While I was at Cogswell, I was part of Project X, a course in which students of various disciplines come together to create a short film. My responsibilities were to light and render shots using Maya and VRay and then composite them together using Nuke. This allowed me to step out of my comfort zone of rigging and scripting and learn more about other parts of the pipeline. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <strong>I am looking to constantly improve my skills in Technical Art, Rigging, and other aspects of Computer Graphics. I am always looking to step out of my comfort zone and try something new, and I believe I can be a valuable asset to any team.
